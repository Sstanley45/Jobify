# Job Tracker Application

Track your aplication Progress.

This is a job tracking app created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The app allows users to register and log in to track the progress of their job applications. Users can also update their profile information or delete their profile if needed. How It's Made

The app is built using the following technologies:

MongoDB: The NoSQL database used to store user profiles and job tracking data. Express.js: A web application framework used for handling server-side logic and routing. React: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface. Node.js: A runtime environment used to run server-side JavaScript.

The app follows the MERN stack architecture, where the frontend is built with React and communicates with the backend built with Node.js and Express.js. The backend interacts with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve user profiles and job tracking information.

# Tech used

MongoDB Express.js React Node.js

# Functionality

The job tracking app provides the following functionalities:

Register/Login: Users can create an account or log in to their existing account to access the app. Job Tracking: Once logged in, users can track the progress of their job applications. The status of a job can be set as pending, interview, or declined. Profile Management: Users can update their profile information, such as their name and contact details, to keep their information up to date. Profile Deletion: If a user wishes to delete their profile and all associated data, they can do so within the app.


# What I Have Learned

During the development of this job tracking app, I have gained experience and knowledge in the following areas:

Building a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. Working with MongoDB to store and retrieve data. Implementing user authentication and authorization using secure login and registration mechanisms. Developing a responsive and intuitive user interface using React. Handling routing and server-side logic using Express.js. Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user profiles and job tracking data.

This project has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in web development and has deepened my understanding of the MERN stack and its components.
